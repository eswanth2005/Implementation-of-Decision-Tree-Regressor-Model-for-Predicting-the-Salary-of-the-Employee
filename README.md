# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import required libraries.
2. Load the salary data from CSV.
3. Check data and handle missing values.
4. Convert 'Position' to numbers using Label Encoding.
5. Set features (Position, Level) and target (Salary).
6. Split data into training and test sets.
7. Train a Decision Tree Regressor model.
8. Predict salaries on test data.
9. Evaluate the model (MSE and R² Score).
10.Predict salary for a given Position and Level.

## Program & Output:
```
